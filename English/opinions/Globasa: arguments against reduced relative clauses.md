# The original idea

Ektor: By the way, speaking of prep phrases, I was wondering if we could add a new optional rule. The rule would be this: Prep phrases that modify nouns can be optionally expressed as "reduced relative clauses" using **hu** and omitting **da sen**. 

**Myaw in sanduku somno.** could alternatively be expressed **Myaw hu (da sen) in sanduku somno.**  The cat (which is) in the box is sleeping.

This way, a phrase like The cat eats the mouse in the box could be disambiguated.  
**Myaw yam maux in sanduku.**  (It happened in the box. In other words, "in sanduku" is modifying the verb, not the noun/mouse.)  
**Myaw yam maux hu in sanduku.** (... the mouse which is in the box.)

# Benefits?

Vanege: The only benefit I see for **hu (prep)** instead of **hu da sen (prep)** is conciseness. (We have two syllables less to say.)

However, I don't think this conciseness is needed. 

## Relative clauses in Globasa are not long

- (ENGLISH) : The cat eats the mouse **which is** in the box. (2 syllables)
- (FRENCH) : Le chat mange la souris **qui est** dans la bo√Æte. (2 syllables)
- (ESPERANTO) : La kato manƒùas la muso **kiu estas** en la skatolo. (4 syllables)
- (GLOBASA) : Myaw yam maux **hu da sen** in sanduku. (3 syllables)
- (GLOBASA*) : Myaw yam maux **hu** in sanduku. (1 syllable)

Compared to English and French, relative clauses in Globasa require only one syllable more. Compared to Esperanto, it requires one syllable less! However, I probably never felt that relative clauses in Esperanto are too long. I don't think the 3 syllables of Globasa would ever annoy me.

## Context is mostly enough

Let's take this English sentence:

- *I kill a duck with a gun*

Is the prepositional phrase "with a gun" about the kill or about the duck? There is no syntactical reason to prefer one to the other. However, I expect all my listeners to think that "with a gun" is about the kill.

The reason is that we all live in a context where ducks don't hold guns. If I was talking about a fictional dystopic society where everything can bear guns, then, as a competent speaker, I would have introduced this setting to my listeners through other sentences and clues beforehand.

## In most cases, misattributing the prepositional phrase is not problematic

Now, let's consider a more everyday sentence:

- *The cat eats the mouse in the box*

Is the *action of eating* in the box, or is *the mouse* in the box? Who cares, it is disgusting! ü§¢ That's what the sender wanted to say, the rest is uncritical information.

Now let's suppose that the box was actually needed for Christmas presents, and now it is full of mouse blood. Well, in that case, the location of the murder is important information. The sender is not happy that they can't use the box anymore.

Let's say the sender meant "the eating is in the box", and the receiver understood "the mouse is in the box". Then there is still no problem, because if you expect the mouse to be in the box, then you expect the eating to be also in the box.

## If misattribution must be avoided, we can use an adjective (or an adverb)

The language has a way to show clearly that the box is about the mouse (and not about the action of eating), and it is very concise: by forming an adjective with **-li**.

**Myaw yam maux in sanduku.** would become **Myaw yam sandukuli maux.**. 

However, we lose the precise positional information given by the preposition *in* (that the mouse is *IN* the box), but then again, in the rarer case where attribution and positional information are critical for successful communication, we can use the complete relative clause.

## If the problem arises, it could be solved naturally

If the imprecision of attribution of prepositional phrases and the 3 syllables of complete relative clauses (**hu da sen ...**) are really too much for some people, I would expect a natural solution to emerge. That natural solution could be easier to learn than a premature written rule.

That solution could possibly be a longer pause between **maux** and **in sanduku** if **in sanduku** is about the action. The solution could possibly be to create a new sentence, like **Myaw yam maux.** **Maux sen in sanduku** or **Na yam sen in sanduku**.

I have no idea what kind of solution would emerge, and if it would eventually emerge, because I am not even sure there is a problem to begin with.

# Risks

As a software developer, I prefer to solve problems only if they happen or if they will certainly happen. Solving a problem that does not exist add extra complexity to the system (the code), and it makes it harder to learn and to maintain for new developers and even for me.

I have a similar vision for constructed languages.

## Relative clauses would be harder to learn

I think the system of relative clauses with **hu** and **da** is one of the best features of Globasa (it allows to always keep the word order), but also one of the strangest for learners.

Many people who learn languages (such as Esperanto) do not use textbooks, but rely on exposure, try to find patterns and try to replicate them. **hu** **da** is (rightfully) complicated, so I want these words to follow only a few rules that are consistently applied, so learners can easily notice these rules.

I find the rule *"**hu da sen** can be replaced with **hu** when they are placed before a preposition"* as an obstacle to the learning process.

## Misinterpretation and overgeneralization

They are too many ways the results of this rule can be misinterpreted by the learner. The learner might think "**da**" is not necessary. The learner might think "**hu da sen**" can always be replaced with "**hu**", without noticing it is only done before a preposition (provided they realize what a preposition it).

If a beginner knows that you can say **myaw hu in sanduku** instead of **myaw hu da sen in sanduku**, I would not be surprised if they say **myaw hu meli** instead of **myaw hu da sen meli**, which is wrong.

(By the way, I don't like the idea of omitting **da**, because it leaves my brain in the expectation that it is coming later in the relative clause, for example as an object or in a prepositional phrase).

## Conclusion

I find the benefit of the extra conciseness not convincing the real need for it is too rare. I am far more concerned by the confusions it would bring to new users of the language when they try to discern the rules and then to apply them.

I am personally against this feature.
