Hello, welcome to this episode.

Today I will teach you the name of colors.

Colors are very useful to describe the world around us.

For that, I will use different blocks in Minecraft, so you can directly see the colors.

I am now using the "Creative Mode" so thatmonsters can't attack or kill me.

Let's start with white.

White is the color of the snow.

Like on the ground, and this snowball.

Gray is a color between white and black.

Coal, for example, is black.

This is coal.

Brown is a very common color.

Dirt (under the grass) is mostly brown.

The chests in Minecraft are also brown.

Red is the color of fire and lava.

Actually, they have three colors: red, orange and yellow.

Orange is the color of the carrots in Minecraft.

It is also the color of pumpkin.

Yellow is the color of gold.

Other example: bees! Bees are yellow and brown.

The most common color in Minecraft is green.

It's the color of grass and of most leaves.

The color blue is also very common.

It's the color of water.

Rivers are also blue because of the water.

The most beautiful color is purple.

It's rare. In order words, it's uncommon.

I like this stone, it's called amethyst.

The last color I want to show you is pink.

Pink is quite cute.

It's the color of the petals of the cherry tree.

That was everything.

Those are useful color names.

Thanks for watching!
