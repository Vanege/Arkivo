Hello!

Today I will visit a village.

I am flying to it.

Hello sheep.

Hello pig.

I just arrived.

So, what is in this first house?

I see only a chest, and a container with water.

There is even grass growing in the house.

Perhaps the house is abandoned, and no one lives here.

However, there is a lot of bread in the chest.

Perhaps a baker used to live here.

I close the door, and I go to the next house.

Beautiful pumpkins.

In this house, there are even fewer things.

There is only a yellow bed, and... two seats?

Perhaps no one lives here.

Oh, the road is blocked by straw.

Strange.

But beautiful flowers.

Blue, red, white, and yellow.

This house is exactly the same as the previous one.

Hey, hello cow.

It seems a villager caught a cow.

I give it freedom.

Boring house.

Oh, the village has an internal sea.

There are villagers there.

Here is a bell, if I ring it, the villagers will panic.

Look them become faster!

That is a Golem, it protects the villagers.

If I attack a villager, the golem will attack me.

This chest has bread, an apple, potatoes, and even gold!

I am not taking it because I am not a thief.

The villager should protect his belongings better.

There are two stone towers, I will visit them.

With this machine, I can make potions!

But I do not know how to use it.

I can also trade with this villager but I do not have anything for it.

Here, I am on the tower!

The second tower is probably totally the same.

There are still two buildings there.

There is a forge, and here is a blacksmith.

I can buy an axe from them.

Oh lava, dangerous place.

They have a chest with many iron items!

Pickaxe, pants, chest armor, ...

If I were in survival mode, they would be useful.

Then, here is a mason.

Despite their profession, they have a very simple house.

And here is a small farm, there are beetroots growing!

That was all!

I hope you enjoyed my visit to the village.
