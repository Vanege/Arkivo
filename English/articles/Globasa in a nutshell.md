# Globasa in a nutshell

Globasa is a modern constructed language with a simple creole-inspired analytic grammar. The vocabulary is globally sourced, with a focus on recognizability and with the ability to compound words to express new concepts.

##  LETTERS AND SOUNDS

Each letter represents a sound, so the pronunciation and the transcription is predictable.

Vowels: **a**, **e** (as in *let*), **i** (as *ee* in *seen*), **o** (as in *for*), **u** (as *oo* in *moon*)

Consonants: **b**, **c** (as *ch* in *chair*), **d**, **f**, **g**, **h** (as *ch* in *Bach*), **j**, **k**, **l**, **m**, **n**, **p**, **r**, **s**, **t**, **v**, **w**, **x** (as *sh* in *shop*), **y**, **z**

The vowel before the last consonant of a word is stressed.

## PRONOUNS

- **mi** (I, me)
- **yu** (you)
- **te** (he, him, she, her, animate it)
- **to** (inanimate it)

Plural pronouns are expressed by repeating the vowel at the first position.

- **imi** (we, us)
- **uyu** (you)
- **ete** (they, them)
- **oto** (they, them)

## NOUNS DO NOT CHANGE

There is no grammatical gender or grammatical number.
A numeral or an adjective can be placed before the noun if the information is necessary.

- **pingo** (apple, apples)
- **un pingo** (an/one apple)
- **plu pingo** ((multiple) apples)

## VERBS DO NOT CHANGE

There is no conjugation. Verbs do not changed based on the subject, the time or aspect.
A particle or an adverb can be placed before the verb if the information in necessary.

- **Mi (nun) yam pingo.** (I eat the apple. I am eating the apple.)
- **Mi le yam pingo.** (I ate the apple.)
- **Mi xa yam pingo.** (I will eat apples.)

## NO DEFINITE ARTICLE

Globasa has no need for a definite article (the). Definiteness mostly understood by context. If necessary, the word **hin** (this) can be used.

- **myaw** (a cat, the cat)
- **hin myaw** (the cat)

## TWO GROUPS

The vast majority of existing words, and new words, belong to one of those two groups:

- noun/verbs (*n/v*) (**danse** (a dance, to dance), **sui** (water, to water), **myaw** (cat, to cat))
- adjective/adverbs (*adj/adv*) (**bon** (good, well), **velosi** (quick, quickly))

In these groups, every noun can be used as a verb without changing the word (and inversely). Every adjective can be used as an adverb without changing the word (and inversely).

The role of a word is defined by its position. In general:

When two noun/verbs follow each other, the second one is a verb

- myaw **danse** (a cat dances)
- danse **myaw** (the dance cats) (Globasa is a suiting language for poetry)

If a verb can't be preceded by a noun, it has to be preceded by **na**.

- **na danse** (to dance)

An adjective-adverb placed before a noun is an adjective.

- **bon** myaw (a **good** cat)

If the adjective-adverb does not follow a noun, it is an adverb.

- myaw **bon** yam / myaw yam **bon** (the cat eats **well**)

## TO BE

All conjugations of verb to be is **sen**. It must not be omitted because it helps to interpret the other words properly based on their position in the sentence.

- To **sen** bon. (It **is** good.)

## WORD ORDER

It is always subject verb object, even in questions and relative clauses.

- Yu oko myaw. (You see a cat.)

## QUESTIONS

**Kam** is placed at the start of yes-no questions.

- **Kam** yu sen myaw? (Are you a cat?)
- Si / No (Yes / No)

**Ke** (which) is placed before what we are asking for.

- Yu oko **ke** myaw? (Which cat are you seeing?)
- Hin myaw. (This cat.)

## WORD COMPOUNDING

New concepts can be expressed by compounding words.

- mena (noun/verb) (a meaning, to mean)
- lari (noun/verb) (a set / a collection, to compose / to collect)
- menalari (noun/verb) (a collection of meanings = a dictionary)
---
- meli (adjective/adverb) (pretty, beautifully)
- eskri (noun/verb) (a writing / to write)
- melieskri (noun/verb) (pretty writing = calligraphy / to do calligraphy)
